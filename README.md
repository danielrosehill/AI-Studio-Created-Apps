## Apps Index

### Audio Applications

## Audio Speaker Editor
![Audio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Audio-1DB954?style=flat-square&logo=spotify&logoColor=white)
![Speech Processing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Speech-FF6F00?style=flat-square)

User uploads audio and Gemini identifies unique speakers through diarization. The app can selectively remove speakers by transcribing the audio, identifying specific speaker segments, and concatenating only the desired segments to create a cleaned audio output. An ambitious application combining speaker identification, audio segmentation, and intelligent audio editing.

![Speech Processing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Speech-FF6F00?style=flat-square)

Speech-to-text-to-text-to-speech (STT-to-TTS) application. User provides a recording which gets transcribed, then an intermediate layer powered by Gemini condenses the message into a more concise form, and finally the condensed text gets synthesized back into speech and presented for playback or recording.

![Productivity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Productivity-34A853?style=flat-square)

A voice recorder, transcriber, and optimizer in one. Records voice input, transcribes it to text, and applies an optimization layer for stylistic or format-based reformatting. Transforms raw voice notes into polished, formatted text documents.

**Screenshot:**

![Notepad Screenshot](screenshots/notepad/1.png)
